# Phase diagram
A simple script to plot the phase diagram.

A phase diagram in physical chemistry, engineering, mineralogy, and materials 
science is a type of chart used to show conditions (pressure, temperature, volume, etc.)
 at which thermodynamically distinct phases (such as solid, liquid or gaseous states) 
 occur and coexist at equilibrium. [More details on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram).

Peter Atkins defines in his  book *physical chemistry* that "phase identifies a state 
of matter, not only about the chemical composition, but also concerning its physical state". This book that can be found at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Physical-Chemistry-9th-Peter-Atkins/dp/1429218126/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=physical+chemistry+nine+edition&qid=1583607029&sr=8-5)
